  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:

    - name: Shutdown Ubuntu instances only
      ansible.builtin.command: /sbin/shutdown -t now
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian" and ansible_facts['distribution'] == "Ubuntu"
```

Explanation:
- The `ansible.builtin.setup` task gathers all facts about the host, including OS family and distribution and you can check the output using debug command and itterate through it as per need.
- The `when` condition is updated to check both `os_family` and `distribution` to ensure the task only runs on Ubuntu instances.
